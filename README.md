### How to play

You are an octocat in the game (specifically a [Jetpacktocat](https://octodex.github.com/jetpacktocat/)), a little character. You need to **click the mouse**, press the  key, or tap (touch screen devices) to levitate, otherwise the octocat will descend. If she hits the top or bottom boundaries that'll end the game.

There will be some obstacles along the way like **forks**, **branches** and some **enemies** who are also known as _pakias_. There are 3 types of pakias (which are actually other octocats as well):

 * sad (pull you)
 * happy (push you)
 * angry (kill you)

Keep safe distance from them (especially from the angry ones)!

There are some collectibles too! Coins for points (yellow for 50, pink for 100, red for 500). [Topguntocat](https://octodex.github.com/topguntocat/)s for invincibility for a short period. [Socialite](https://octodex.github.com/socialite/) cats will spawn clones that'll destroy anything that comes in their way!

### About

This HTML5 Game (OctoPakia) has been happily _changed_ for the [Github's Game Off 2015 (_The Game Has Changed_)](https://github.com/blog/1972-the-game-has-changed).

### Credits

This game was initially named _Pappu Pakia_ and it was created by [Rishabh](https://twitter.com/_rishabhp) and [Kushagra](https://twitter.com/solitarydesigns). Thanks to [Rezoner](http://rezoner.net/) for Music.

[IonicaBizau](https://twitter.com/IonicaBizau) changed it by replacing the sprites into [Octocats designed by GitHubbers](http://octodex.github.com). Also the interface was enchated by using [Primer](http://primercss.io/) and [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com/).

All other sounds produced by personal thingies like mouths, hands and books. Some tricks and tips that we learnt while making this game has been shared on [CodeTheory](http://codetheory.in) and [CSSDeck](http://cssdeck.com/codecasts).
